# PRODIGY_CS_02

Image Encryption Tool
A simple Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using an XOR operation. The tool allows you to apply a key to encrypt an image and decrypt it using the same key.

Features
1. Encryption: Encrypt images using an XOR operation with a user-defined key.

2. Decryption: Decrypt images using the same key used for encryption.

3. File Format: Supports `.png` and`.jpg`  format for encrypted and decrypted images.

4. Customizable Key: Choose an encryption key (integer between 0 and 255).
